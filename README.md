SPADA (Splicing-led Protein Alterations Discovered Agilely) is a pipeline oriented to finding interesting isoform switches between two conditions. An analysis of the TCGA dataset using this pipeline was published in [Climente-González *et al.* (2017)](http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(17)31104-X). For information about how to run SPADA on your dataset, please read the [documentation](docs/index.md).
