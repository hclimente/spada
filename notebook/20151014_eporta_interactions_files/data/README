1 - Files *_switches.txt

	These files contain the same information as the ones that you initially sent us, with the addition of which interactions are
	lost, kept or switched whenever we found at least one lost interaction. Each line is an array tab-separated with the 
	following fields:
	
	1 - 94: Entrez ID, just as you sent
	2 - ACVRL1: Symbol, just as sent
	3 - uc001rzk.2: Isoform expressed in normal tissue, just as sent
	4 - uc010snm.1: Isoform Expressed in cancer tissue, just as sent
	5 - ENSP00000373574: ENSEMBL protein ID for the normal isoform
	6 - ENSP00000392492: ENSEMBL protein ID for the cancer isoform
	
	The rest of the line contains a variable number of entries that look like this:
	7..n - Lost-INHBA-ENSG00000122641-ENSP00000242208-PF01064_32_100-PF00019_319_426
	
	Each one of these entries contains information regarding an interaction that we mapped to a domain in the isoform expressed
	in the normal tissue. The fields are separated by "-" and are as follows:
	
	a) Lost: The first field says if the interaction is "Kept", "Lost" or "Switched" due to the isoform switch
	b) INHBA: Symbol of the interacting gene
	c) ENSG00000122641: ENSEMBL gene ID of the gene
	d) ENSP00000242208: ENSEMBL protein ID of the isoform of the interacting gene
	e) PF01064_32_100: Interacting domain in the first protein (ACVRL1 -see field "2"- in this example), with the PFAM id, the start and end position
	   of the domain
	f) PF00019_319_426: Interacting domain in the second protein (INHBA in this example), with the PFAM id, the start and end position
	   of the domain
	   
	Note that a single interaction between two genes will appear as many times as isoforms the interaction partner has and that the
	consequences might be different depending on which partner isoform one is considering

2 - File "network_interactions_lost_both_sides.edges"

	This file contains information about interactions that are lost from both ends due to isoform switches
