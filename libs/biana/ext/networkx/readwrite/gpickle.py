Pickled Graphs
**************

Read and write NetworkX graphs as Python pickles.

Note that NetworkX graphs can contain any hashable Python object as
node (not just integers and strings).  So writing a NetworkX graph
as a text file may not always be what you want: see write_gpickle
and gread_gpickle for that case.

This module provides the following :

Python pickled format:
Useful for graphs with non text representable data.

    write_gpickle(G, path)
    read_gpickle(path)
